## Introduction

This project was incepted to eventually create a universal, full-featured IPMI
FRU Information generator / editor library and command line tool, written in
full compliance with [IPMI FRU Information Storage Definition v1.0, rev. 1.3.](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/servers/ipmi/ipmi-platform-mgt-fru-infostorage-def-v1-0-rev-1-3-spec-update.html)



## libfru

The full developer's documentation for the library is available at
https://ipmitool.codeberg.page/frugen/

This is the library behind frugen. It is aimed at providing a very easy-to-use
API that completely (well, almost) abstracts the user from the details of the
binary FRU file internals. All data that the user has to deal with is either
plain text or hex strings (in rare occasions raw binary data buffers may also
be supported).

Most memory management in the library is automatic and the users don't have to
care about freeing any internal allocations as long as they use the library API
properly. The central entity of the library is \ref fru_t, the structure type
that represents a fully decoded FRU information as a whole. You will find
fields for every FRU area inside that structure, and there is a lot of
functions to work with that structure. You may load it from a file or from
an in-memory buffer, and you may save it back. In the meantime you're free
to modify the data in the structure as you want.

The main idea is that all the data in \ref fru_t is in text, human-readable
format, except for integer fields like, for instance, `fru_t.chassis.type`.
The API however has functions to set the values from binary buffers. Those
include \ref fru_setfield_binary() and \ref fru_set_internal_binary().

Any errors detected by the API calls they will report via a familiar POSIX-like
mechanism of a global thread-specific \ref fru_errno variable, which in `libfru`
is enhanced to provide the caller with the information on where exactly the
error has occured.

Please read the doxygen-formatted documentation thoroughly before first use.
You may also check `frugen.c` and `frugen-json.c` code for library usage examples.

So far supported in libfru are:

  * Data decoding from all the encoding types defined by the FRU specification.
    Exception:

    * Unicode is not supported
    * Language codes aren't actually supported, all text is decoded as if it
      was English (ASCII+Latin1)

  * Data encoding into all the defined formats (binary, BCD plus, 6-bit ASCII, language code specific text).
    You may specify the encoding type you want. The exceptions are:

    * All text is always encoded as if the language code was English
      (ASCII+Latin1, 1 byte per character)

  * Setting fields (both custom and standard) from a binary buffer
    (will be converted to hex strings to store in \ref fru_t)

  * Internal use area decoding into a hex string

  * Internal use area creation from:

    * A hex string (auto sizing, just to accomodate the provided data)
    * A binary buffer (arbitrary size limited by FRU specification only)

  * All informatio areas creation and decoding (Chassis, Board, Product):

    * All the mandatory fields:

      * Area-specific non-string fields:

        * Chassis Type
        * Board Language Code
        * Board Mfg. Date/Time, etc.)
        * Product Language Code

      * All the string-like fields

    * Any custom fields

  * Multirecord area creation and decoding with the following record types:

    * Management Access Record with the following subtypes:

      * System UUID (uuid)
      * System name (sname)
      * System management URL (surl)
      * System ping address (spingaddr)
      * Component name (cname)
      * Component management URL (curl)
      * Component ping address (cpingaddr)

    * Any other MR record types decoding and encoding as 'raw' type:
      data is a hex string for decoding, or a hex string or a binary
      buffer for encoding.

  * FRU file creation (in a memory buffer or in an actual file)
  * FRU file loading (from a memory buffer or from an actual file).
    \b NOTE: mmap() is used to open a file, may not work on device nodes
             directly. See \ref fru_loadfile().

_NOT supported:_

  * Miltirecord area record encoding/decoding for types/subtypes other
    than the listed above.

## frugen

The frugen tool supports the following (limitations imposed by the libfru library):

  * Internal use area (from/to a raw hex string)
  * Board area creation (including custom fields)
  * Product area creation (including custom fields)
  * Chassis area creation (including custom fields)
  * Multirecord area creation and decoding (see libfru supported types above)

### The limitations:

  * Internal use area creation/modification is available only from template file,
    not available from the command line arguments.

_NOTE:_ You may use `frugen` to modify some standard fields even on FRU files that
        contain unsupported multirecord area records.
        Those records will be decoded as 'custom' (raw) type and encoded back
        the same way, preserving their data.

_NOTE:_ You may use `frugen` to fix area and record checksums in your FRU file.
        For that purpose use binary input and output formats, and specify the debug (`-g`)
        flags to ingnore the errors in your source FRU file. The checksums for the
        destination FRU file will be recalculated properly according to the specification.
        Please note that FRU files with bad header checksum will not be processed as
        there is no debug flag to ignore that error.

### Operation principles

  The `frugen` tool takes a template in any of the supported formats and builds
  an 'exploded' or 'decoded' version of fru file in memory. It then takes
  command line arguments and applies any changes to the fru fields specified by
  those arguments. After that step is complete, it either encodes/packs the
  data into a binary fru file, or dumps it in json or plain text format to a
  file or stdout.

  Any text field in FRU has an encoding type. The IPMI FRU specification
  defines 4 types: Text (ASCII), 6-bit ASCII, BCD+, and binary. The tool can
  detect which encoding suits best for the provided data or it can preserve the
  original encoding used in the source template.

  If autodetection is chosen (see the 'set' option below), then the tool will
  attempt to encode the new data the most compact/efficient way.  It will start
  with 6-bit ASCII encoding as it yields the most compact result. If your data
  string contains anything beyond uppercase ASCII, digits, and punctuation, the
  tool will expand the charset and attempt to use BCD+. If that doesn't fit,
  a binary encoding will be attempted. If there is anything beyond hex digits,
  then finally the data string will be copied as is (plain text encoding).

  \b NOTE: Previous versions of `frugen` would start with binary encoding,
           having the rest of the order the same.

  If you choose to preserve the original encoding, please note that `frugen`
  will fail if your new data cannot be encoded using the same encoding type as
  the original. For instance, if your original data was "ACME" encoded as 6-bit
  ASCII, and you want to preserve the encoding, but the new data is "A Company
  Making Everything", then the tool will fail because 6-bit encoding doesn't
  allow for lowercase characters.

  Input binary FRU files (or templates as considered by frugen) may contain
  multirecord areas. Such areas consist of many so-called 'records' of various
  types, including some OEM ones that aren't covered by IPMI FRU specification.
  It is impossible for `frugen` or `libfru` to support them all, but the best
  effort is made to not destroy them at least. When using a binary FRU file as
  a template, `frugen` will load such records as raw type (see \ref fru_mr_rec_t.raw),
  and will save them into json output as 'custom'

  A similar approach is used for the iternal use area, the contents of which are
  completely OEM-specific and can not be parsed. The are is decoded as a hex string
  and then encoded back into a raw binary.

### Invocation

For the most up-to-date information on the frugen tool invocation and options, please
use `frugen -h`, below is an example of the output of that command:

```
FRU Generator v3.0.0.gXXXXXXX (C) 2016-2025, Alexander Amelkin <alexander@amelkin.msk.ru>

Usage: frugen [options] <filename>

Options:

	-d <argument>, --board-date <argument>
		Set board manufacturing date/time, use "DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM" format.
		By default, if the date is neithers specified by this option, nor
		is given in the input template, the resulting output depends on the
		output format and presence of '-u' option as follows:

		-o     | -u specified         | -u not specified
		-------|----------------------|-------------------------
		binary | set to 'unspecified' | current system date/time
		json   | not included         | "auto"
		text   | "Unspecified"        | "Unspecified (auto)"
		-------|----------------------|-------------------------.

	-g <argument>, --debug <argument>
		Set debug flag (use multiple times for multiple flags):
			fver  - Ignore wrong version in FRU header
			aver  - Ignore wrong version in area headers
			rver  - Ignore wrong record version in multirecord area
			asum  - Ignore wrong area checksum (for standard areas)
			rhsum - Ignore wrong record header checksum (for multirecord)
			rdsum - Ignore wrong record data checksum (for multirecord)
			rdlen - Ignore wrong record data size (for multirecord)
			aeof  - Ignore missing end-of-field in info areas, try to decode till the end
			reol  - Ignore missing EOL record, use any found records.

	-h[<argument>], --help[=<argument>]
		Display this help. Use any option name as an argument to show
		help for a single option.

		Examples:
			frugen -h     # Show full program help
			frugen -hhelp # Help for long option '--help'
			frugen -hh    # Help for short option '-h'.

	-j <argument>, --json <argument>
		Load FRU information from a JSON file, use '-' for stdin.

	-o <argument>, --out-format <argument>
		Output format, one of:
		binary - Default format when writing to a file.
		         For stdout, the following will be used, even
		         if 'binary' is explicitly specified:
		json   - Default when writing to stdout.
		text   - Plain text format, no decoding of MR area records.

	-r <argument>, --raw <argument>
		Load FRU information from a raw binary file, use '-' for stdin.

	-s <argument>, --set <argument>
		Set a text field in an area to the given value, use given encoding
		Requires an argument in form [<encoding>:]<area>.<field>=<value>
		If an encoding is not specified at all, frugen will attempt to
		preserve the encoding specified in the template or will use 'auto'
		if none is set there. To force 'auto' encoding you may either
		specify it explicitly or use a bare ':' without any preceding text.

		Supported encodings:
			auto      - Autodetect encoding based on the used characters.
			            This will attempt to use the most compact encoding
			            among the following.
			6bitascii - 6-bit ASCII, available characters:
			             !"#$%^&'()*+,-./
			            1234567890:;<=>?
			            @ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO
			            PQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_
			bcdplus   - BCD+, available characters:
			            01234567890 -.
			text      - Plain text (Latin alphabet only).
			            Characters: Any printable 8-bit ASCII byte.
			binary    - Binary data represented as a hex string.
			            Characters: 0123456789ABCDEFabcdef

		For area and field names, please refer to example.json

		You may specify field name 'custom' to add a new custom field.
		Alternatively, you may specify field name 'custom.[+]<N>' to
		replace the value of the custom field number N given in the
		input template file. A plus sign before <N> indicates that you
		wish the new field to inserted before the existing entry at
		rather than replace it.

		You may also specify either H/S/F or T/E/L letter for <N> to
		respectively indicate that you want the entry to be _inserted_
		at the head/start/first position in the list, or added at
		the tail/end/last position.

		Examples:

			frugen -r fru-template.bin -s text:board.pname="MY BOARD" out.fru
				# (encode board.pname as text)
			frugen -r fru-template.bin -s board.pname="MY BOARD" out.fru
				# (preserve original encoding type if possible)
			frugen -r fru-template.bin -s :board.pname="MY BOARD" out.fru
				# (auto-encode board.pname as 6-bit ASCII)
			frugen -j fru-template.json -s binary:board.custom=0102DEADBEEF out.fru
				# (add a new binary-encoded custom field to board, at the end of list)
			frugen -j fru-template.json -s binary:board.custom.h=0102DEADBEEF out.fru
				# (add a new binary-encoded custom field to board, at the head of list)
			frugen -j fru-template.json -s binary:board.custom.2=0102DEADBEEF out.fru
				# (replace custom field 2 in board with new value)
			frugen -j fru-template.json -s binary:board.custom.+2=0102DEADBEEF out.fru
				# (insert a custom field at position 2 in board, old 2 becomes 3).

	-t <argument>, --chassis-type <argument>
		Set chassis type (hex). Defaults to 0x02 ('Unknown').

	-u, --board-date-unspec
		Don't use current system date/time for board mfg. date, use 'Unspecified'.

	-U <argument>, --mr-uuid <argument>
		Add/update a System Unique ID (UUID/GUID) record in MR area.

	-v, --verbose
		Increase program verbosity (debug) level.

	-V, --version
		Show the program version.

Example (encode from scratch):
	frugen -s board.mfg="Biggest International Corp." \
	       --set board.pname="Some Cool Product" \
	       --set text:board.pn="BRD-PN-123" \
	       --board-date "10/1/2017 12:58:00" \
	       --set board.serial="01171234" \
	       --set board.file="Command Line" \
	       --set binary:board.custom="01020304FEAD1E" \
	       fru.bin

Example (decode to json, output to stdout):
	frugen --raw fru.bin -o json -

Example (modify binary file):
	frugen --raw fru.bin \
	       --set text:board.serial=123456789 \
	       --set text:board.custom.1="My custom field" \
	       fru.bin
```

### JSON

__Dependency:__ [json-c library](https://github.com/json-c/json-c)

The frugen tool supports JSON files. You may specify all the FRU info fields (mind the
general tool limitations) in a file and use it as an input for the tool:

    frugen --json example.json fru.bin

An example file 'example.json' is provided for your reference.

NOTE: The JSON file for frugen is allowed to have C-style comments (`/* comment */`),
which is an extension to the standard JSON format.

## Building

### Linux

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make

There is a number of optional parameters for cmake to control build procedure:

|Option          |Default|Description                                                          |
|----------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|BINARY_32BIT    | OFF   |Build 32-bit versions of everything                                  |
|BUILD_SHARED_LIB| ON    |Build libfru as a shared library, implies dynamic linking of `frugen`|
|BINARY_STATIC   | OFF   |Force full static linking of `frugen`, makes it HUGE                 |
|ENABLE_JSON     | ON    |Enable JSON support if json-c library is available                   |
|JSON_STATIC     | OFF   |Link json-c library statically into `frugen`                         |

**NOTE**: `BUILD_SHARED_LIB` and `BINARY_STATIC` are not mutually exclusive: while first option
controls building `libfru`, second one is related to `frugen`. When both options are enabled
static and shared versions of `libfru` will be compiled. When both options are disabled libfru
will be linked statically into `frugen`, while other libraries are linked shared.

To build a debug version use the following command:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DDEBUG_OUTPUT=yes ..
    make

To build a semi-statically linked version (with `libfru` and `libjson-c` built-in), use:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DBINARY_STATIC=ON -DJSON_STATIC=ON ..
    make

To build project documentation (requies `doxygen`), run `make docs`.

### Windows (cross-compiled on Linux)

You will need a MingW32 toolchain. This chapter is written in assumption you're
using `x86_64-w64-mingw32`.

First of all you will need to create a `x86_64-w64-mingw32-toolchain.cmake`
file describing your cross-compilation toolchain.

This file assumes that you use `$HOME/mingw-install` as an installation prefix
for all mingw32-compiled libraries (e.g., `libjson-c`).

    # the name of the target operating system
    SET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Windows)

    SET(MINGW32_INSTALL_DIR $ENV{HOME}/mingw-install)

    # which compilers to use for C and C++
    SET(CMAKE_C_COMPILER x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc)
    SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++)
    SET(CMAKE_RC_COMPILER x86_64-w64-mingw32-windres)

    # here is the target environment located
    SET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/ ${MINGW32_INSTALL_DIR})

    # adjust the default behaviour of the FIND_XXX() commands:
    # search headers and libraries in the target environment, search
    # programs in the host environment
    set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
    set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
    set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)

    # let the compiler find the includes and linker find the libraries
    # MinGW linker doesn't accept absolute library paths found
    # by find_library()
    include_directories(BEFORE ${MINGW32_INSTALL_DIR}/include)
    set(CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH ${MINGW32_INSTALL_DIR}/lib ${MINGW32_INSTALL_DIR}/usr/lib ${CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH})

Once you have that file, build the tool as follows:

    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=x86_64-w64-mingw32-toolchain.cmake .
    make
